## Core Philosophy

### "One-World Ache, Tidal Evo Ripples"

**Ebb & Bloom** is about intimate connection to a single, living world that remembers your every action. You are a modular pixel catalyst - a creature whose traits ripple through the ecosystem, shaping it through the tidal rhythm of growth (bloom) and decay (ebb).

### The Experience We're Creating

**80% Single World Immersion**
- Deep connection to ONE procedurally generated world
- Every action leaves scars that the world remembers
- Hours exploring layers and depth, not breadth
- Your traits inherit into the local ecosystem
- Packs form and evolve based on your playstyle

**20% Poetic Exiles**
- Rare earned hops to 5-10 sibling worlds
- Carry ONE scar echo across worlds
- Kin calls pull you back home
- Not escape, but breathing room

### Not This

❌ **NOT** an infinite universe explorer (No Man's Sky scope)  
❌ **NOT** a collect-em-all progression grind  
❌ **NOT** a menu-driven crafting sim  
❌ **NOT** a desktop game ported to mobile  
❌ **NOT** a multiplayer competitive arena

### This Instead

✅ **Intimate**: One world you reshape over hours, not minutes  
✅ **Tidal**: Ebb (pollution/decay) and Bloom (growth/harmony) cycles  
✅ **Evolutionary**: Your traits inherit into the ecosystem  
✅ **Touch-First**: Gestures as primary language, haptics as heartbeat  
✅ **Impermanent**: Nova cycles reset world but persist journal wisdom

## What Makes This Special

### Innovation #1: Magnetic Resource Snapping

**Traditional crafting**: Open menu → select recipe → wait for craft → close menu

**Ebb & Bloom**: Place ore next to water → SNAP! They fuse into alloy

- **Magnetic Proximity**: Resources attract when adjacent
- **Affinity-Based**: 8-bit flags determine what combines (HEAT + FLOW = alloy)
- **Procedural Permutations**: Infinite combinations through affinity overlap
- **No Menus**: Touch to gather, swipe to place, world handles the rest

### Innovation #2: Trait Inheritance Ecosystem

**Your traits don't just affect you - they shape the world:**

- **Proximity-Based**: Creatures near you evolve similar traits
  - Example: Your flipper feet → critters gain webbed paws
  
- **Dilution Mechanics**: Traits weaken 50% per generation
  - Level 3 flipper → Level 1 webbed paws → Level 0 (fades)
  
- **Hybrid Emergence**: Opposing traits create new forms
  - flow + void = tidal scar
  - heat + life = forge bloom
  
- **Behavioral Mirroring**: Your playstyle shapes creature AI
  - Harmony player → cooperative packs that gift resources
  - Conquest player → aggressive raiders that contest territory
  - Frolick player → whimsical herds that dance and explore

### Innovation #3: Procedural Haiku Journaling

**Every significant moment generates a haiku** that captures the emotional resonance:

```
Flipper wakes the vein;
Paws remember the tide's grace—
Kin bloom from your stride.
```

- **Jaro-Winkler Guard**: Prevents repetition (<20% similarity)
- **Procedural Metaphors**: Generated from action context
- **Persistent Across Cycles**: Journal survives nova resets
- **Stardust Kin Calls**: Haikus hint at sibling world connections

### Innovation #4: Touch as Language

**Gestures aren't shortcuts - they ARE the game:**

| Gesture | Game Action | Feel |
|---------|-------------|------|
| **Swipe** | Stride, carve terrain | Forward momentum |
| **Pinch** | Zoom, siphon resources | Focus |
| **Hold** | Dispatch packs on quests | Command |
| **Tap** | Collect, interact | Light touch |
| **Double-Tap** | Quick action | Urgency |
| **Drag** | Move inventory | Deliberate |
| **Rotate** | Camera, inspect | Perspective |

**Haptic Feedback = World's Heartbeat:**
- Light buzz for harmony blooms
- Heavy rumble for combat lashes
- Crescendo for nova pulse
- Heartbeat for abyss reclamation

## Player Experience

### First 10 Minutes (Onboarding)

**Goal**: Feel the world breathe under your touch

1. **Catalyst Creation** (2 min)

   - Discover first biome (water/grass/flowers/ore)
   - Critters scatter and observe

3. **First Snap** (5 min)
   - Tap ore tile → collect (buzz)
   - Tap water tile → collect (ripple)
   - Place them adjacent → SNAP! (rumble + haiku)

## Design Pillars

### 1. Intimate Scale

**Principle**: Quality over quantity - one world that evolves WITH you

- 80% of playtime in single world
- Depth through layers (surface → abyss)
- Every action has consequences
- World remembers your history
- Packs inherit your traits

**Anti-Pattern**: Throwing more content = better game

### 2. Tidal Rhythm

**Principle**: Growth and decay are both beautiful

- Pollution isn't punishment - it's transformation
- Shocks mutate world into new forms
- Nova cycles create impermanent ache
- Bloom: Harmony players nurture life
- Ebb: Conquest players embrace void

**Anti-Pattern**: Good vs. evil morality

### 3. Touch as Poetry

**Principle**: Gestures should feel like conducting world's symphony

- No buttons - only touch
- Haptics create physical bond
- Gestures build momentum
- One-handed portrait play
- 60 FPS non-negotiable

**Anti-Pattern**: Touch as mouse replacement

### 4. Evolutionary Memory

**Principle**: Your legacy outlives you

- Traits inherit into ecosystem
- Journal persists across cycles
- Stardust echoes carry between worlds
- Packs quest your old scars
- Haikus narrate your arc

**Anti-Pattern**: Progress as numbers going up

### 5. Mobile-First Forever

**Principle**: Not a port - designed for touch from day one

- Gestures are primary input
- Haptics are essential feedback
- Portrait orientation default
- One-handed play possible
- Battery-conscious rendering
- Lean APK (4MB!)

**Anti-Pattern**: "We'll optimize for mobile later"
