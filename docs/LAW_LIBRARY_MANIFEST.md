## What Yuka Can Now Answer

### Generation 1 (Organisms):
✅ "What body size can survive this gravity?" → **Structural constraints**
✅ "How fast can it move?" → **Cost of transport × energy budget**
✅ "Can it fly in this atmosphere?" → **Wing loading × air density**
✅ "How good is its vision?" → **Eye diameter × diffraction limit**
✅ "What should it eat?" → **Optimal foraging theory**
✅ "How long to maturity?" → **Von Bertalanffy growth model**

### Generation 2 (Social):
✅ "Should they form packs?" → **Anti-predator benefits vs food competition**
✅ "How large should packs be?" → **Dunbar's number × brain size**
✅ "Should they defend territory?" → **Resource value vs defense cost**
✅ "Will they cooperate?" → **Hamilton's rule + reciprocal altruism**
✅ "How much time grooming?" → **Social maintenance requirements**

### Generation 3 (Tools):
✅ "Can they use tools?" → **EQ threshold (>2.5)**
✅ "Innovation rate?" → **EQ² × population size**
✅ "Will knowledge spread?" → **Cultural transmission fidelity**
✅ "How long to learn?" → **Learning rate × problem complexity**

### Generation 4 (Economy):
✅ "Should they trade?" → **Comparative advantage**
✅ "What's the equilibrium price?" → **Supply = Demand**
✅ "Optimal specializations?" → **√(market size / coordination cost)**
✅ "Will commons collapse?" → **Tragedy of commons + Ostrom principles**
✅ "Economic growth rate?" → **Solow model (capital, labor, technology)**

### Generation 5 (Culture):
✅ "Will cooperation evolve?" → **Iterated prisoner's dilemma + reputation**
✅ "Honest signaling?" → **Costly signaling theory**
✅ "Language complexity?" → **Vocabulary size × recursion capability**
✅ "Memory capacity?" → **Neuron count × synapses**
✅ "Can they deceive?" → **Theory of mind (2nd order)**

### Projecting 5,000 Years:
✅ "Population trajectory?" → **Logistic growth + stochastic noise**
✅ "Will this lineage go extinct?" → **Population viability analysis**
✅ "Economic steady state?" → **Solow convergence model**
✅ "Social structure evolution?" → **Band → Tribe → Chiefdom → State thresholds**
✅ "Technological progress?" → **Endogenous growth (researchers × productivity)**
✅ "Climate impact?" → **Temperature gradients × rainfall × NPP**

## The Philosophy

### RENDERING = Simple
Just interpret the properties:
- Mass + density → sphere size
- Elements + temperature → color/texture
- Locomotion type → leg count and shape
- **Visual is DERIVED from simulation**

### SIMULATION = Infinite Depth
Every formula Yuka could possibly need:
- **Schmidt-Nielsen** for how far they can travel
- **Kleiber** for how much they eat
- **Dunbar** for pack size
- **Hamilton** for cooperation
- **Ricardo** for trade
- **Solow** for economic growth
- **von Bertalanffy** for individual growth
- **Damuth** for population density

**Yuka doesn't guess. Yuka CALCULATES.**

## The Goal

**When Yuka asks "Should this tribe transition to agriculture?"**

It doesn't rely on vibes. It calculates:

1. **Climate**: Growing season length (degree-days)
2. **Soil**: Nutrient availability (NPK ratios)
3. **Hydrology**: Water access (aquifer depth)
4. **Population**: Labor availability (working-age ratio)
5. **Technology**: Tool sophistication (EQ × innovation rate)
6. **Economics**: Storage capacity (surplus requirements)
7. **Social**: Can organize labor? (governance complexity)
8. **Ecology**: Carrying capacity change (agricultural NPP)
9. **Health**: Disease risk (sedentism effects)
10. **Future**: 50-year projection (Solow model + demographics)

**ALL FROM FORMULAS.**

Then Yuka can answer: **"Yes, in 3 years, if they develop irrigation, with 73% confidence."**

**THAT'S the game we're building.**
