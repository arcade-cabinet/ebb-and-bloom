## [2025-01-XX] - Initial Vision Extraction

### Added
- **docs/vision/README.md** - Executive summary and table of contents
- **docs/vision/01_initial_design.md** - Initial 2D tile-based concept ("EvoForge")
- **docs/vision/02_snapping_permutations_complexity.md** - Affinity system and infinite permutations
- **docs/vision/03_mobile_platform_integration.md** - Capacitor/Ionic Vue pivot
- **docs/vision/04_raycast_renderer_choice.md** - Evolution to raycasted 3D (deferred)
- **docs/vision/05_ecology_and_reactivity.md** - Reactive world systems
- **docs/vision/06_materials_to_alloys_crafting.md** - Crafting system deep dive
- **docs/vision/07_villages_quests_emergence.md** - Emergent content systems (deferred)
- **docs/vision/08_world_hopping_and_continuity.md** - Stardust hops and persistence (deferred)
- **docs/vision/09_mobile_perf_constraints.md** - Performance targets and optimizations
- **docs/vision/10_vertical_slice_plan.md** - MVP scope and roadmap
- **docs/vision/manifest.json** - Machine-readable manifest of all stages
- **docs/architecture/00_overview.md** - System decomposition and architecture principles
- **docs/architecture/tech-comparison.md** - Technology evaluation and recommendations

### Changed
- **docs/vision/01_initial_design.md** - Rewritten to align with North Star vision
- **docs/vision/02_snapping_permutations_complexity.md** - Rewritten to align with North Star vision
- **docs/vision/03_mobile_platform_integration.md** - Rewritten to align with North Star vision

### Notes
- Vision extracted from Grok conversation archive (`memory-bank/archive/Grok-Procedural_Pixel_World_Evolution_Game.md`)
- Current implementation is 2D tile-based; vision evolved to raycasted 3D (deferred)
- Several vision stages marked as "deferred" pending performance validation or prerequisite systems
- Manifest tracks all stages with confidence scores and status (verified/deferred/in_progress)

---

## Future Changes

### Planned
- Update vision stages as implementation progresses
- Add performance validation results for raycast 3D
- Expand deferred stages (villages, quests, world-hopping) as prerequisites are met
- Update tech-comparison.md with real-world performance data

### Under Consideration
- Additional vision stages for combat system, ritual mechanics, audio system
- Architecture refinements based on implementation learnings
- Performance optimization guides based on real device testing
