# Balance Assessment - Ebb & Bloom

**Date**: 2025-01-XX  
**Status**: Pre-Stage 2 Review

---

## What's Well Balanced ✅

### 1. Core Loop Foundation
- **Snapping → Trait Inheritance → Behavior Profiling → Pollution** creates a clear feedback loop
- Each system reinforces the others (no isolated mechanics)
- Playstyle diversity supported (Harmony/Conquest/Frolick all viable)

### 2. Consequence System
- **Pollution isn't punishment** - transforms world instead of blocking progress
- **Behavior profiling adapts** - world reacts, doesn't judge
- **Shocks create variety** - not failure states

### 3. Progression Gates
- **Evo Points** unlock traits (clear progression)
- **Trait synergies** reward experimentation
- **Pollution thresholds** unlock new content (shocks)

### 4. Replayability Hooks
- **Procedural generation** (seed variety)
- **Behavior adaptation** (different reactions each playthrough)
- **Endless evolution** (world transforms continuously, never resets)

## What's Missing or Unbalanced ⚠️

### 1. **Clear Goals/Milestones** ❌ CRITICAL GAP
**Problem**: Game is sandbox with "no win condition" but players need objectives

**What's Missing**:
- **Achievement System**: Unlock milestones (e.g., "Create 10 alloys", "Form 5 packs", "Discover all biomes")
- **Discovery Goals**: "Find all biomes", "Unlock all traits", "Trigger all shock types"
- **Narrative Arc**: What's the player working toward? (Even sandboxes need direction)

**Recommendation**: Add soft goals that guide without forcing:
- Trait unlock progression (visual progress bar)
- Biome discovery checklist
- Shock type completion as "chapter" markers
- Haiku collection milestones

### 2. **Resource Management Depth** ⚠️ SHALLOW
**Problem**: Resources just snap together - no scarcity, no storage, no management

**What's Missing**:
- **Inventory Limits**: Can you carry infinite resources?
- **Resource Scarcity**: Are resources infinite or do they deplete?
- **Storage System**: Where do resources go when not snapping?
- **Resource Value**: Are all resources equal or do some have higher value?

**Recommendation**: Add light resource management:
- Inventory capacity (scales with traits like StorageSacs)
- Resource regeneration (slow regrowth, not infinite)
- Resource rarity (common vs. rare resources)
- Storage structures (optional - don't overcomplicate)

### 3. **Exploration Incentives** ⚠️ WEAK
**Problem**: What drives players to explore beyond initial area?

**What's Missing**:
- **Hidden Areas**: Secret biomes, rare resources, unique creatures
- **Distance Rewards**: Better resources further from spawn?
- **Discovery Rewards**: First-time discoveries grant bonuses?
- **Map/Compass**: How do players know where they've been?

**Recommendation**: Add exploration hooks:
- Rare resources spawn in distant chunks
- First discovery of each biome grants Evo Points
- Hidden "echo chambers" (rare areas with unique traits)
- Fog of war or exploration map

### 4. **Feedback Loops** ⚠️ INCOMPLETE
**Problem**: Core loop exists but lacks immediate gratification

**What's Missing**:
- **Visual Feedback**: Snapping needs particle effects, animations
- **Audio Feedback**: Sound design for all actions
- **Haptic Sync**: Haptics mentioned but not fully integrated
- **Progress Indicators**: Visual feedback for pollution, behavior, loyalty

**Recommendation**: Enhance feedback (Priority 1):
- Particle bursts on snap (blue wisps, red sparks)
- Haptic patterns for each action type
- Visual evolution animations for trait inheritance
- UI indicators for pollution, behavior profile, pack loyalty

### 5. **Content Variety** ❌ TOO LIMITED
**Problem**: Only 5 recipes, 10 traits, 4 biomes - will feel repetitive quickly

**Current State**:
- 5 recipes (very limited)
- 10 traits (decent but needs more)
- 4 biomes (too few)

**Recommendation**: Content expansion (Priority 4):
- 10+ recipes (current plan)
- 15+ traits (current plan)
- 5+ biomes (current plan)
- More creature types (currently 4 species)

### 6. **Long-Term Progression** ⚠️ UNCLEAR
**Problem**: Evo Points unlock traits, but what's the long-term arc?

**What's Missing**:
- **Trait Upgrade Path**: Can traits be upgraded or just unlocked?
- **Mastery System**: Do players master certain playstyles?
- **Endgame Content**: What happens after unlocking all traits?
- **Long-Term Progression**: How does the world evolve over extended play?

**Recommendation**: Add progression depth:
- Trait upgrades (spend more Evo Points to enhance traits)
- Playstyle mastery (unlock special abilities for high playstyle scores)
- Endgame goals (e.g., "Perfect Harmony" - 100% harmony, 0% pollution)
- Long-term world transformation (world evolves based on cumulative actions)

### 7. **Social/Sharing** ⚠️ MENTIONED BUT NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Problem**: Seed sharing mentioned but no implementation

**What's Missing**:
- **Seed Sharing UI**: How do players share seeds?
- **Seed Discovery**: How do players find interesting seeds?
- **Haiku Sharing**: Can players share haikus?
- **Community Features**: Leaderboards? Challenges?

**Recommendation**: Add sharing features:
- Seed export/import (copy-paste seed string)
- Haiku export (screenshot or text)
- Community seed library (optional - don't overcomplicate)

### 8. **Tutorial/Onboarding** ❌ CRITICAL GAP
**Problem**: Mentioned as missing but essential for balance

**What's Missing**:
- **First-Time Experience**: How do new players learn?
- **Gesture Tutorials**: How do players learn gestures?
- **Catalyst Creator**: How do players create their character?
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Don't overwhelm with all systems at once

**Recommendation**: UX Polish (Priority 1):
- Interactive tutorials for gestures
- Catalyst creator with trait explanations
- Progressive onboarding (teach one system at a time)
- Contextual hints (tooltips, help system)

## Balance Scorecard

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Core Loop** | 8/10 | ✅ Strong foundation |
| **Progression** | 5/10 | ⚠️ Needs goals/milestones |
| **Content Variety** | 4/10 | ❌ Too limited |
| **Feedback** | 3/10 | ❌ Missing visual/audio |
| **Exploration** | 4/10 | ⚠️ Weak incentives |
| **Replayability** | 7/10 | ✅ Good hooks |
| **Balance** | 6/10 | ⚠️ Needs tuning |

**Overall**: 5.3/10 - **Needs Work Before Launch**

## Critical Path to Balance

### Must Fix Before Launch (Priority 1)
1. **UX Polish** - Tutorials, onboarding, visual feedback
2. **Content Expansion** - More recipes, traits, biomes
3. **Goals/Milestones** - Soft objectives to guide players

### Should Fix (Priority 2)
4. **Resource Management** - Light inventory/scarcity
5. **Exploration Incentives** - Hidden areas, discovery rewards
6. **Long-Term Progression** - Trait upgrades, mastery system

### Nice to Have (Priority 3)
7. **Social/Sharing** - Seed sharing, haiku export
8. **Audio System** - Sound design for all actions
9. **Visual Effects** - Particles, animations, polish

---

## What Feels Missing Most

### 1. **Purpose** (Biggest Gap)
Players need to know what they're working toward. Even sandboxes need direction.

**Solution**: Add soft goals:
- Trait unlock progression
- Biome discovery checklist
- Shock type completion as milestones
- Achievement system

### 2. **Immediate Gratification**
Core loop exists but lacks "juice" - needs visual/audio/haptic feedback.

**Solution**: Enhance feedback (Priority 1):
- Particle effects
- Sound design
- Haptic sync
- Visual animations

### 3. **Content Depth**
Only 5 recipes feels shallow. Players will exhaust content quickly.

**Solution**: Content expansion (Priority 4):
- 10+ recipes
- 15+ traits
- 5+ biomes
- More creature types

---

## Recommendations Summary

**Before Stage 2 Implementation**:
1. ✅ Add achievement/milestone system (soft goals)
2. ✅ Enhance visual/audio/haptic feedback
3. ✅ Expand content (recipes, traits, biomes)
4. ✅ Add exploration incentives (hidden areas, discovery rewards)
5. ✅ Light resource management (inventory, scarcity)

**After Core Systems**:
6. Long-term progression (trait upgrades, mastery)
7. Social/sharing features
8. Audio system
9. Visual effects polish

---

**Verdict**: Core loop is solid, but needs **goals, feedback, and content** to feel complete. Focus on UX polish and content expansion before adding new systems.
