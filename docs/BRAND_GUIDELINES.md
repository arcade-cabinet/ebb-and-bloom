## Tagline: Hybrid Approach (Option D) ✅ COMMITTED

**Selected Tagline**: **"Shape Worlds. Traits Echo. Legacy Endures."**

**Approach**: Direct gameplay verbs with poetic language that captures the emotional core

**Rationale**: 
- Clear gameplay verbs (Shape, Craft, Evolve) communicate what you DO
- Poetic language (Echo, Remember, Legacy) captures the emotional resonance
- Avoids pure mysticism while maintaining depth
- More memorable than pure technical while being clearer than pure poetry

**Alternatives Considered** (for reference):
- "Craft. Evolve. Your World Remembers." (Minimalist + memory theme)
- "Your Actions Shape Worlds. Your Traits Echo Through Time." (Most descriptive)
- "Build Worlds. Inherit Traits. Watch Them Bloom." (Action-oriented + growth metaphor)

## Brand Voice: Hybrid (Option D) ✅ COMMITTED

**Approach**: Adaptive voice based on context - Poetic for world/atmosphere, technical for systems, playful for onboarding

### Poetic Voice
**Tone**: Meditative, evocative, philosophical  
**Use When**: Marketing copy, haiku generation, world descriptions  
**Example**:
> "Your chainsaw whispers felled the ancient oak; now thorns rise in defiance. The world doesn't scold—it answers with thorns in your supply lines and skies choked with soot-spawned swarms."

### Technical Voice
**Tone**: Clear, direct, systems-focused  
**Use When**: Documentation, tutorials, system explanations  
**Example**:
> "Resources snap together based on affinity flags. Ore (HEAT+METAL) + Water (FLOW) = Alloy. The system scales infinitely through procedural permutations."

### Playful Voice
**Tone**: Light, engaging, discovery-focused  
**Use When**: Onboarding, tooltips, casual descriptions  
**Example**:
> "Place ore next to water and watch them SNAP into alloy! No menus, no waiting—just magnetic magic. Your flipper feet make water resources more likely to snap."

### Hybrid Example (Recommended Default)
**Tone**: Balanced blend of all three  
**Example**:
> "Every action leaves an echo. Your traits ripple through the ecosystem—chainsaw hands make critters evolve burr claws, flipper feet spawn webbed paws. The world remembers."
