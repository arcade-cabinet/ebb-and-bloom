# Archived Instructions

This directory contains legacy instruction files that have been migrated to GitHub Copilot Agents.

## Migration Status

✅ **Migrated to Agents**: All instructions have been converted to GitHub Copilot Agents in `.github/agents/`

The new agents provide:
- Better integration with GitHub Copilot
- Specialized tool access per agent
- More focused expertise
- Better discoverability in Copilot UI

## Old Files

- `mobile-game-development.instructions.md` → Now `mobile-performance.md` agent
- `vue-typescript-ecs.instructions.md` → Now `ecs-architecture.md` agent

## New Agent Location

See `.github/agents/` for the new GitHub Copilot Agents.

These instruction files are kept for reference but are no longer used by GitHub Copilot.
