- Environmental (wind, rain, vegetation)
- Cosmic ambience (stellar activity)
- Events (explosions, rumbles)

### Haptics
- Impact forces (collision physics)
- Material texture (roughness → vibration)
- Event patterns (earthquake, click, pulse)

## RENDERING SYSTEM: COMPLETE ✅

**ALL from laws. NO asset files.**

## What Yuka Can Answer

**Visual:**
- "Why is sky blue?" → Rayleigh scattering
- "Why are plants green?" → Chlorophyll absorption
- "Why does bronze look red?" → Cu composition

**Audio:**
- "What does 50kg creature sound like?" → 250Hz fundamental
- "Sound in 0.5atm?" → Speed of sound calculation
- "Thunder rumble why?" → Low freq survives attenuation

**Haptic:**
- "Impact force?" → Collision calculation
- "Material feel?" → Hardness → vibration freq
- "Earthquake intensity?" → Magnitude → pattern

**Evolutionary:**
- "How fast do traits change?" → Selection coefficient
- "When does species split?" → Genetic divergence
- "Adaptation time?" → Fixation probability

**Everything:** 1,500+ formulas. Zero guesses.
