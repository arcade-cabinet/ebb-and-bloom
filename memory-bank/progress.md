# Beast Mode Build Status

## Current Progress (2025-11-07 22:42 UTC)

### ✅ COMPLETED
- Backend REST API structure
- Gen 0: Planetary accretion (simplified - needs full Yuka)
- Gen 1: Creature system with basic Yuka Goals
- Gen 2: Pack system with REAL Yuka FuzzyModule + Flocking (6/8 tests passing)
- Gen 0-2: Complete Visual Blueprint generators with causal rules
- Memory bank updated
- Checkpoint commit pushed

### 🔄 IN PROGRESS  
- Gen 3-6: Visual Blueprint generators (pattern established, executing now)

### ⏳ NEXT UP
1. Implement Gen 3 (Tools) with Yuka FuzzyModule for emergence
2. Implement Gen 4 (Tribes) with territory + cooperation
3. Implement Gen 5 (Buildings) with construction Goals
4. Implement Gen 6 (Religion/Democracy) with belief systems
5. Refactor Gen 1-2 to USE visual blueprints
6. Complete test suite for ALL generations
7. SQLite + Drizzle for persistence

## Key Architecture Locked

**WARP + WEFT Grid:**
```
              MACRO                MESO                 MICRO
Gen 0:    Stellar system    |  Accretion       | Element dist
Gen 1:    Biome niches       |  Population      | Physiology  
Gen 2:    Territory network  |  Pack sociology  | Individual
Gen 3:    Tool ecosystems    |  Categories      | Properties
Gen 4:    Tribal networks    |  Governance      | Roles
Gen 5:    Settlements        |  Building types  | Construction
Gen 6:    Ideologies         |  Institutions    | Beliefs
```

**VisualBlueprint Structure:**
- description
- canCreate / cannotCreate (causal rules)
- representations (materials, shaders, procedural, colors)
- compatibleWith / incompatibleWith (matrix)
- compositionRules (how to combine)

## Build Velocity
- No asking, just building
- Checkpoint commits every major milestone
- Memory bank stays updated
- Full autonomy until complete

## Token Budget Management
- Current: ~75k remaining
- Strategy: Build in logical chunks, commit frequently
- If approaching limit: commit, summarize, continue fresh
