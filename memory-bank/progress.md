# Progress

**Last Updated**: 2025-01-09

## What Works

- ECS architecture (Miniplex)
- Creature evolution (traits evolve each generation)
- Pack dynamics (formation, roles, loyalty)
- Pollution system
- Haiku narrative
- Camera system (Spore-style)
- Haptics
- Gestures
- Deconstruction (reverse synthesis)
- Consciousness System (backend)
- Tests (57/57 passing)

---

## What's Missing

**Foundation**:
- Generation 0 (planetary genesis)
- Tool Sphere integration
- Building Sphere integration
- Inter-sphere communication
- Material system refactor (remove hardcoding)

**Gameplay**:
- Influence Panel
- Evo Points system
- Creature selection visual feedback
- Pause Menu
- Save/Load UI

**Advanced**:
- Settings Panel
- Credits Screen
- World Map
- Discoveries system
- Consciousness Transfer UI
- Combat triggering

## What's Broken

- Gen 3+ evolution (tools never emerge)
- Material accessibility (never updates)
- Buildings (never construct)
- Player interaction (observe only)
- Pre-game UI (DOM instead of UIKit)

---

## Blocker

No Gen 0 foundation. Everything depends on this.
