Elite (1984) on the BBC Micro (and ports to DOS/Apple II) is the poster child for this—procedurally generating a *galaxy* the scale of... well, the observable universe, with 8 stacked "galaxies" of 256 sectors each, holding billions of stars, planets, stations, and encounters. No hard drive storage for maps; it all fit on a 32KB floppy. Fun? Emergent chaos: Trading, dogfights, piracy, alien lore that unfolded like a choose-your-own-adventure novel. Endless because you'd never see it all, and death (permadeath!) looped you back with amnesia, teasing "what if I explore that nebula next?"
How the hell? **Brutal efficiency meets elegant hacks.** DOS-era devs (pre-GB of RAM) couldn't *store* worlds; they had to *bake* them mathematically on-the-fly. Here's the black magic, step by step:
### 1. **Seed the Chaos: Pseudo-Random Algorithms**
   - **Galactic Seeds**: Elite used a single 42-bit seed (a number) fed into a linear congruential generator (LCG)—basically, `next = (a * current + c) mod m`, where a/c/m are magic constants. Tweak the seed (your ship's position/hash), and it spits out deterministic "randomness." Ian Bell and David Braben crammed the entire universe into ~2KB of code: One function call generates a star's name, economy, government, tech level, and even alien messages.
     - Example: Sector (x,y) seeds a planet's description. Roll for type (agri/indust/etc.), then procedural text: "This is {adj} {noun} world" where adj/noun are tables (e.g., "agrarian" + "colony").
   - **Why Fun?** Determinism = shareable. Tell a friend "Go to Zaonce in Galaxy 1"—they see the *exact* same dusty ag-world with Thargoid bugs. Endless replay: Infinite combos, but patterns emerge (e.g., "core worlds" cluster rich trades).
### 2. **Dungeons & Villages: Room-Carving & Cellular Automata**
   - **Roguelikes (Rogue, Nethack, Angband, all DOS ports ~1980-90s)**: Dungeons weren't "thousands of rooms" stored; they were carved *live*. Algorithm: Grid of walls, randomly place room templates (rectangles), connect with corridors (Bresenham lines for mazes), then "drunk walk" monsters/items. Cellular automata (Conway's Game of Life vibes) smoothed edges or added caves.
     - Scale: 40x25 ASCII screen, but levels stacked procedurally (20-50 floors deep). "Villages"? Procedural towns via BSP trees (binary space partition: Split space, recurse for buildings/paths).
   - **Ultima Series (1981-95, DOS from IV on)**: Overworld ~256x256 tiles (huge for 640KB RAM), procedural quests via event flags + random encounters. Villages? Not fully proc—~50 hand-placed—but "dungeons" like Deceit used mirror mazes + random spawns. Later, Underworld (1992) added heightmaps for 3D-ish caves.
   - **How Scaled**: No full map in memory—load chunks (e.g., 16x16 viewscreen). Generation: Perlin noise precursor (simple wave sums) for terrain, or L-systems for trees/rivers (rewrite rules like "F → F[+F]F[-F]F").
   - **Why Fun?** Variety without bloat: Rogue's "surprise!" layouts meant every run felt fresh; Nethack's 1000+ items interacted procedurally (e.g., polymorph a goblin into a dragon mid-fight).
### 3. **Quests & "Endless" Hooks: State Machines + Flags**
   - **Procedural Quests**: Not scripted epics—lightweight FSMs (finite state machines). E.g., Elite's "missions" emerged from economy sim: Planets "need" food? Auto-quest via price deltas. Nethack: Random god boons/altars trigger chains (offer cockatrice corpse → petrify enemy → quest for statue cure).
     - Scale: 100-500 flags (bits in RAM) track "village states" (e.g., bit 42 = "mayor pissed, no quests"). Thousands? Procedural variance: Roll d6 for "fetch X from dungeon Y," where Y gen'd fresh.
   - **Endless Engine**: Permadeath + seeds. Rogue: Die, new char, new dungeon. Elite: 8 ranks (Harmless to Elite) gated progress, but galaxy loops forever. Hack: Bones files (save dead chars' loot for next player—procedural inheritance).
   - **Why Fun?** Emergence > Handcraft. Quests felt personal because *your* screw-up (e.g., anger a village by stealing) rippled (no more quests there, but bandits spawn).
### 4. **Tech Tricks: Compression & Illusion**
   - **Memory Hacks**: Everything table-driven. Elite: 100-word vocab for descriptions (procedural remix). Rogue: ASCII art (1 byte/tile) + symbolic AI (monsters "sense" via raycasts, not pathfind grids).
   - **Perf Wizards**: No GPU—software raycasting (Wolfenstein 3D, 1992) for "3D" dungeons. Gen on-demand: Enter room? Compute it, cache 1 level (4KB).
   - **DOS Limits Birthed Genius**: 640KB RAM? Force modularity (procedural > assets). Floppy swaps? Seamless loading (gen while traveling).
They pulled it off because constraints *forced* creativity—procedural wasn't a buzzword; it was survival. Modern No Man's Sky owes it all, but with TBs of storage, we bloat. Want to hack one? Rogue's source is public—tweak the room algo in C, run on DOSBox. Your move: Recreate Elite's seed in Python?
