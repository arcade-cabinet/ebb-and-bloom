# Product Context

## Why This Exists
Ebb & Bloom addresses the desire for mobile games that offer:
- **Meaningful progression** without predatory monetization
- **Intimate exploration** vs endless procedural sprawl
- **Emergent narratives** through player actions and evolution systems
- **Touch-native gameplay** designed for mobile, not ported

## Problems It Solves
1. **Mobile game fatigue**: Repetitive grind loops and pay-to-win mechanics
2. **Shallow procedural generation**: Infinite worlds without depth or consequence
3. **Disconnected gameplay**: No sense of world impact or evolutionary legacy
4. **Poor mobile UX**: Desktop games awkwardly ported to touch controls

## How It Works
### Core Loop (Stage 1)
1. **Stride & Explore**: Swipe to move catalyst through procedurally generated meadow chunks
2. **Gather Resources**: Tap to collect ore, water, and other materials
3. **Craft & Build**: Gesture-based crafting (drag ore + water = alloy)
4. **Leave Scars**: Your actions create persistent pollution/changes in the world
5. **Evolve**: Proximity-based trait inheritance system (future stages)

### User Experience Goals
- **First 30 seconds**: Smooth onboarding, immediately start exploring
- **First 5 minutes**: Collect first resource, craft first item
- **First 10 minutes**: Explore multiple chunks, see world variety
- **First 30 minutes**: Understand crafting combos, see world scarring effects

### Key Differentiators
- **One persistent world** vs infinite random worlds
- **Modular creature system** with visual trait inheritance
- **Gesture-driven interactions** built for touch
- **Haptic feedback integration** for tactile game feel
- **Deterministic world gen** (same seed = same world)

## Target Experience
Players should feel:
- **Curious**: What's in the next chunk?
- **Impactful**: My actions matter to this world
- **Creative**: Experimenting with crafting combinations
- **Connected**: Building relationship with catalyst and creatures
- **Contemplative**: Tidal rhythms and evolutionary ache

## Not This
- Endless runner or idle game
- Gacha/loot box mechanics
- PvP or competitive multiplayer
- Desktop-first design
- Purely survival/combat focused
