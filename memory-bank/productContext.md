# Enhanced Product Context

## What Makes This Special

### The "Ache" Philosophy
This game is built around emotional resonance, not mechanical optimization. Every design decision serves the feeling of:
- **Intimate connection** to a single world that remembers you
- **Tidal rhythm** of growth and decay
- **Evolutionary legacy** through trait inheritance
- **Tactile poetry** via touch gestures and haptic feedback

### Why Mobile-Only
Not a port - designed from scratch for touch:
- Gestures are the primary language (swipe, pinch, long-press)
- Haptic feedback creates physical connection to world
- Portrait orientation for one-handed play
- 60FPS performance target on mid-range Android

### Core Innovation: Magnetic Resource Snapping
Unlike traditional crafting menus, resources "snap" together based on proximity and affinity. Ore + Water = Alloy happens naturally when you place them adjacent. Scales infinitely through procedural permutations.

### Trait Inheritance System
Your creature's traits don't just affect you - they influence the ecosystem:
- Proximity-based inheritance (creatures near you evolve similar traits)
- Dilution mechanics (traits weaken by 50% each generation)
- Hybrid emergence (flow + void = tidal scar)
- Behavioral mirroring (your playstyle shapes creature AI)

## Target Experience

### First 10 Minutes
- Create modular pixel creature with trait allocation
- Stride through procedurally generated meadow
- Discover first resource snap (ore + water = alloy)
- Feel haptic feedback and see pollution increase
- Watch world react to your actions

### First Hour
- Unlock multiple trait combinations
- Build first creature pack via proximity inheritance
- Experience minor pollution shock (world mutation)
- Complete first resource chain (wood → tool → advanced snap)
- See haiku journal capture your story

### Long-term Engagement
- 45-minute nova cycles reset world but persist journal
- Rare stardust travel to sibling worlds (5-10 variants)
- Deep trait exploration (25 total traits with synergies)
- Emergent narratives from ecosystem evolution
- Community seed sharing (deterministic world gen)
