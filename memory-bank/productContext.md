## What This Is

Procedural evolution game where consciousness flows through living forms in an ever-changing ecosystem.

**Core Mechanic**: Shape evolutionary destiny through touch. Every action creates pressure that Yuka AI spheres respond to organically.

**Tagline**: "Shape Worlds. Traits Echo. Legacy Endures."

---

## How It Works

1. **Seed Input**: Player enters 3-word seed (Minecraft-style) OR random
2. **Generation 0**: Planetary genesis creates unique world from seed
3. **Generation 1**: 8 archetypal creatures spawn near Primordial Wells
4. **Generation 2+**: Yuka AI evolves everything based on environmental pressure

**Key Innovation**: NO hardcoded progression. Everything emerges from seed-driven planetary physics and evolutionary pressure.

## Why It's Special

1. **Truly procedural**: Every seed = unique planet with unique evolution

5. **Consciousness transfer**: Player isn't bound to one creature
