## What This Is

Procedural evolution game where consciousness flows through living forms in an ever-changing ecosystem.

**Core Mechanic**: Seed-driven planetary physics creates unique worlds. Yuka AI evolves creatures, tools, buildings, and civilizations based on environmental pressure.

**Tagline**: "Shape Worlds. Traits Echo. Legacy Endures."

---

## How It Works

1. **Seed Input**: Player enters 3-word seed (`v1-word-word-word`) OR random
2. **Generation 0**: Planetary genesis creates unique world from seed (accretion simulation)
3. **Generation 1**: Creatures spawn with AI-generated archetypes
4. **Generation 2+**: Yuka AI evolves everything based on WARP/WEFT data flow

**Key Innovation**: NO hardcoded progression. Everything emerges from seed-driven planetary physics and AI-generated archetype pools.

## Generational Progression

### Gen 0: Planetary Genesis
- Stellar system context (Population I/II stars, binary systems)
- Accretion dynamics (hot/cold zones, giant impacts)
- Element distributions (metal-rich, carbon-rich, volatiles)
- **Output**: Stratified planet with material accessibility rules

### Gen 1: Creatures
- Ecological niches (predator/prey ratios, biome structure)
- Population dynamics (carrying capacity, migration)
- Individual physiology (metabolism, lifespan, morphology)
- **Output**: Creature archetypes with Yuka goal hierarchies

### Gen 2: Packs
- Territorial geography (pack boundaries, resource distribution)
- Pack sociology (hierarchy, cooperation, competition)
- Individual pack behavior (flocking, hunting, defense)
- **Output**: Pack formations with Yuka FuzzyModule decisions

### Gen 3: Tools
- Tool ecosystems (categories, properties, capabilities)
- Tool crafting processes (material requirements, synthesis)
- Individual tool properties (reach, hardness, durability)
- **Output**: Tool archetypes with emergence conditions

### Gen 4: Tribes
- Inter-tribal networks (alliances, conflicts, trade)
- Governance systems (leadership, roles, decision-making)
- Traditions and rituals (cultural transmission)
- **Output**: Tribe formations with cooperation benefits

### Gen 5: Buildings
- Building types (shelter, storage, workshop, temple)
- Construction processes (material requirements, labor)
- Building details (capacity, benefits, visual properties)
- **Output**: Building archetypes with construction rules

### Gen 6: Religion & Democracy
- Cosmologies (belief systems, myths, rituals)
- Institutions (governance, law, social structures)
- Beliefs (values, practices, cultural norms)
- **Output**: Abstract system archetypes

## Player Experience

### Core Loop
1. Enter seed phrase (or use random)
2. Watch Gen0 planetary formation
3. Observe Gen1 creatures evolve
4. See Gen2+ systems emerge organically
5. Explore visual blueprints rendered in 3D

### Visual Experience
- **Gen0**: Planetary sphere with PBR materials and textures
- **Gen1**: Creature visualization with traits
- **Gen2**: Pack formations and flocking behaviors
- **Gen3**: Tool rendering
- **Gen4**: Tribe territories
- **Gen5**: Building structures
- **Gen6**: Abstract systems visualization

## Why It's Special

1. **Truly procedural**: Every seed = unique planet with unique evolution
2. **AI-generated content**: All archetypes from OpenAI workflows
3. **Yuka AI coordination**: Systems evolve each other organically
4. **Visual blueprints**: Complete rendering instructions embedded
5. **WARP/WEFT flow**: Causal chains ensure coherent evolution
