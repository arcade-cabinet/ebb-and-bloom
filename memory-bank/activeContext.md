# BEAST MODE BUILD LOG

## Active Context
**Mission:** Complete Gen 0-6 implementation with full Yuka integration + Visual Blueprints
**Mode:** FULL AUTONOMY - No user input needed
**Started:** 2025-11-07

## Architecture Locked In
✅ WARP (vertical): Gen N → Gen N+1 causal influence chains
✅ WEFT (horizontal): MACRO/MESO/MICRO at each generation
✅ Visual Blueprints: Complete rendering instructions with causal rules
✅ OpenAI integration: AI-sources ALL parameter pools deterministically

## Build Sequence
- [x] Backend REST API structure
- [x] Gen 0 planetary accretion (simplified, needs full Yuka physics)
- [x] Gen 1 creatures (basic, needs visual blueprint integration)
- [x] Gen 2 packs (with REAL Yuka FuzzyModule + Flocking - 6/8 tests passing)
- [x] Gen 0-1 visual blueprint generators
- [ ] Gen 2-6 visual blueprint generators (IN PROGRESS)
- [ ] Refactor Gen 1-2 to USE visual blueprints
- [ ] Implement Gen 3 Tools with Yuka FuzzyModule
- [ ] Implement Gen 4 Tribes with territory systems
- [ ] Implement Gen 5 Buildings with construction
- [ ] Implement Gen 6 Religion/Democracy
- [ ] Complete test coverage ALL generations
- [ ] Update memory bank

## Key Decisions Made
1. **No more hardcoded values** - Everything AI-sourced from visual blueprints
2. **Deterministic seed components** - macro/meso/micro select from AI pools
3. **Causal chains** - canCreate/cannotCreate enforce physical reality
4. **Visual blueprints** - Complete rendering instructions for future frontend
5. **YOLO mode** - Build actual game systems, not simplified proofs

## Current Focus
Completing Gen 2-6 visual blueprint generators following established pattern.
