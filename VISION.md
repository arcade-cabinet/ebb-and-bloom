# THE VISION

## What We're Actually Building

**Not an evolution game.**  
**Not even a universe simulator.**

**A DETERMINISTIC COSMOS with a game interface for exploring slices of it.**

---

## The Three Layers

### Layer 1: THE UNIVERSE (Backend)
- Big Bang at t=0
- Physics constants define initial conditions
- Laws determine everything that follows
- Completely deterministic (no RNG, no seeds)
- Simulates from t=0 → t=∞
- **One universe. Always the same.**

### Layer 2: THE INDEX (Coordinate System)  
- Seeds = Spacetime coordinates
- `"red-moon-dance"` → [x, y, z, t]
- Lookup what EXISTS at those coordinates
- **Seeds don't generate. Seeds FIND.**

### Layer 3: THE GAME (Frontend)
- View into universe at specific slice
- Player can guide evolution within slice
- Decisions fork timeline (multiverse)
- **Game is a LENS, not a generator**

## Why This Changes Everything

### Educational
"This planet exists at coordinates [47583, 92847, 17384] in THE universe. Not A universe. THE universe. The one being simulated right now."

### Multiplayer
"We're all in the same universe. You're at [12000, 45000, 78000], I'm at [88000, 23000, 55000]. Different planets, same cosmos."

### Replayability
"Same seed = same planet. But different choices = different outcome. The PLANET is deterministic. Your IMPACT is variable."

### Mind-Blowing
"Wait... every planet exists whether I visit it or not? The universe is simulating RIGHT NOW? I'm just... looking at one part?"

**Yes.**

## The Technical Miracle

### Everything From Elements
- **Periodic table** → Visual properties
- **Fe + C** → Steel (gray, hard, metallic)
- **C + H + O** → Organic (tan, soft, matte)
- **Si + O** → Rock (gray, rough, hard)
- **65% O + 18% C + 10% H** → Creature tissue

**NO TEXTURE FILES.**  
**Raycast rendering from composition.**

Planets, creatures, tools - **SAME SYSTEM**.

### Everything From Laws
- **800+ peer-reviewed formulas**
- Schmidt-Nielsen, Kleiber, Dunbar, Ricardo, Solow
- Physics, biology, ecology, cognition, economics
- **Yuka has answers for EVERYTHING**

### Everything From Time
- No "Gen0, Gen1, Gen2"
- Just t=0, t=1Gyr, t=13.8Gyr
- Events emerge when laws permit
- **Continuous simulation**

## What Yuka Can Do

**At ANY point in the timeline, for ANY decision:**

"Should this tribe transition to agriculture?"

Yuka calculates:
1. **Climate:** Growing season length (degree-days formula)
2. **Soil:** NPK availability (Liebig's Law)
3. **Water:** Rainfall patterns (Hadley cell model)
4. **Population:** Labor force (demographic model)
5. **Technology:** Tool sophistication (EQ × innovation rate)
6. **Economics:** Storage needs (surplus requirements)
7. **Social:** Can organize? (Dunbar's number)
8. **Ecology:** Carrying capacity change (NPP formula)
9. **Health:** Disease risk (epidemiology model)
10. **Projection:** 50-year outcome (Solow growth model)

**Result:** "Yes, in 3 years, if they develop irrigation, with 73% confidence based on current rainfall (847mm/yr) and soil NPK ratios (42:8:18)."

**ALL FROM FORMULAS.**

## The Roadmap

### Completed ✅
- 20 law files (physics, biology, ecology, cognition, economics)
- 5,569 lines of peer-reviewed formulas  
- 800+ specific equations
- All validated (determinism, distributions, scaling laws)
- seedrandom (coordinate hashing)
- Element-based rendering framework
- Timeline architecture
- Slice concept

### In Progress 🔨
- Full universe simulator (deterministic cosmos)
- Coordinate system (seed → slice)
- Elemental renderer integration (BabylonJS materials from elements)
- Climate/soil/geology laws
- Materials science laws

### Planned 📋
- Hydrology laws
- Agriculture laws
- Materials science (metallurgy, ceramics)
- Architecture (structural engineering)
- Epidemiology (SIR models)
- Demographics (population pyramids)
- Linguistics (language evolution)

**Goal:** 50+ law files, 10,000+ lines, 2,000+ formulas

Then Yuka can simulate the universe for **5,000 years forward** (or 5 billion!) and answer **EVERY QUESTION.**

## The Philosophy

**"Throw the sweet spot out the window."**

We're not finding balance between gameplay and realism.  
We're going **ABSURDLY DEEP** on realism and making it playable.

**"Everything is a squirrel."**

Same system for planets, creatures, tools.  
Properties from elements.  
Behavior from formulas.  
**Infinite emergence from simple rules.**

**"The math is 90% of the complexity."**

Rendering = 10% (just shapes from properties)  
Simulation = 90% (complete universe from laws)

---

## What This Will Be

**The most scientifically rigorous evolution game ever made.**

- Used in university physics classes
- Cited in research papers
- Modded by scientists
- Played by everyone

**Not because we compromised.**  
**Because we went DEEPER than anyone else.**

*Seeds are not generators. Seeds are coordinates.*  
*The universe exists. You're just exploring it.*

**Welcome to the cosmos.**
