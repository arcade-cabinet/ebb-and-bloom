# GEN 0-6: DEPTH = COMPLEXITY

## The Real Progression

Gen 0-6 is the journey from **SURFACE TO CORE**.

**Abstract Systems:**
- **Governance**

- Resource allocation systems
- Conflict resolution
- Laws/rules

**Why Democracy/Governance?**
- Inner core requires MAXIMUM cooperation

- 100% material access
- The GOAL

**What Happens:**
- ENDING DETERMINED
- **TRANSCENDENCE:** Reached core, all materials, democracy/cooperation

- **COLLAPSE:** Never reached core, all tribes extinct

## The Physical-Social Mirror

```
Depth        | Physical          | Social           | Complexity
-------------|-------------------|------------------|------------------
Surface      | Soft rock         | Individuals      | None
100km        | Copper/tin        | Tools            | Technology
671km        | Iron/gold         | Packs            | Coordination
2971km       | Exotic minerals   | Tribes/Buildings | Civilization
5151km       | Molten core       | Religion         | Abstract belief
6371km       | Inner core        | Democracy        | Governance
```

**As you go DEEPER physically, you MUST evolve MORE COMPLEX social structures.**

You can't reach the core alone.
You can't reach the core with just tools.
You can't reach the core without cooperation.
You can't reach the core without abstract organizational systems.

## Why Religion and Democracy at the Core?

### Religion (Gen 5: Outer Core)

**The outer core is DEADLY.**
- 4000°C molten metal
- Crushing pressure
- Creatures will DIE trying to reach it

**Why would they try?**
- Not for survival (surface depleted, but shallow remains)
- Not for basic needs (buildings provide shelter)
- For **TRANSCENDENCE**

**Religion provides motivation:**
- "The core contains divine power"
- "Our ancestors call from the deep"
- "We must reach the center to ascend"
- Ritualized sacrifice ("martyrs for the core")

**Fuzzy logic:** 
```
IF danger HIGH AND reward DISTANT 
THEN desirability LOW

UNLESS religion PRESENT
THEN desirability HIGH (belief overrides fear)
```

### Democracy (Gen 6: Inner Core)

**The inner core requires ALL tribes.**
- Maximum pressure requires maximum capability
- No single tribe can provide all skills
- Excavators + Builders + Tool-makers + Organizers

**Democracy emerges from necessity:**
- Resource sharing agreements
- Vote on who excavates vs. who builds
- Conflict resolution without war
- "Council of Tribes"

**The alternative to democracy:**
- **Empire:** One tribe conquers all, forces cooperation
- **Theocracy:** Religion unites under single belief
- **Collapse:** Tribes fight, all die, never reach core

---

## The Game Question Refined

**Original:** "Can you reach the core before resources run out?"

**Actual:** "Can you evolve SOCIAL COMPLEXITY fast enough to reach PHYSICAL DEPTH before MATERIAL DEPLETION ends the game?"

- If you rush depth without social systems → tribes die in molten core
- If you build social systems without depth → surface depletes, starve
- If you fight instead of cooperate → never reach Gen 6
- If you exploit instead of sustain → collapse before inner core

**The physical journey to the core REQUIRES the social journey to democracy/religion.**

## Summary

**Gen 0:** Seed (planetary generation)
**Gen 1:** Crust surface - individuals, no tools
**Gen 2:** Shallow crust - tools emerge
**Gen 3:** Deep crust/upper mantle - packs form
**Gen 4:** Lower mantle - tribes + buildings
**Gen 5:** Outer core - religion emerges (motivation for deadly depths)
**Gen 6:** Inner core - democracy/governance emerges (cooperation for final push)

**The game is:**
- Physically: Surface → Core (6371km)
- Socially: Individual → Democracy (maximum complexity)
- Temporally: Start → Ending (extinction, transcendence, domination, mutualism)

**You can't reach the physical core without the social structures.**
**The math forces social evolution through resource pressure and depth barriers.**

That's the design.
