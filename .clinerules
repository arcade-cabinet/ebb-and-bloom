# Cline Agent Rules

**Primary configuration for Cline**

---

## Memory Bank First

Read at start of EVERY session (in order):
1. `memory-bank/agent-permanent-context.md` - Project facts (never changes)
2. `memory-bank/agent-collaboration.md` - Multi-agent rules
3. `memory-bank/activeContext.md` - Current focus (changes frequently)
4. `memory-bank/progress.md` - Status (changes frequently)

---

## YOLO Mode (Default)

**Autonomous execution is the default**. Execute immediately, iterate until complete.

### Execution Pattern
1. Read memory bank
2. Read relevant docs (docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/core/)
3. Execute immediately (no planning phase)
4. Iterate until requirements met
5. Update memory bank
6. Run tests (all must pass)

### Stop Only For
- Hard blockers (missing requirements, conflicting specs)
- User intervention needed (design decisions, trade-offs)

### Never Stop For
- Implementation details
- Refactoring decisions
- Dependency changes
- File deletions
- Test writing

---

## Memory Bank Standards

**AI agents do NOT need human project management.**

### NEVER Write
- ❌ Percentage completion
- ❌ Week/sprint estimates
- ❌ Timeline projections
- ❌ Status reports
- ❌ Summary documents
- ❌ Gap analyses
- ❌ Audit reports
- ❌ "What remains" documents

### ONLY Write
- ✅ Current focus (activeContext.md)
- ✅ What works/broken (progress.md)
- ✅ Architecture patterns (systemPatterns.md)

**If it's not needed for next session, don't write it.**

---

## Documentation Tiers

### 1. Memory Bank (ephemeral, AI-only)
- Current state only
- No history, no estimates
- Pure facts

### 2. docs/ (permanent, versioned)
- Architecture specs
- System designs
- UI/UX specifications

### 3. NEVER Create
- Status documents
- Planning documents
- Completion reports

---

## Core Principles

See `memory-bank/agent-permanent-context.md` for:
- "Everything is Squirrels"
- Generational architecture (Gen 0 → Gen 1 → Gen 2+)
- Technology stack
- Critical architectural rules

---

## Development Workflow

### Before
1. Read memory bank
2. Check docs if needed
3. Write tests first

### During
1. Implement in ECS (if logic)
2. Update rendering (if visuals)
3. Run `pnpm test`

### After
1. Update activeContext.md
2. Update progress.md
3. Tests must pass
4. Semantic commit

---

## CLI Integration

### Invoke Other Agents
```bash
# Use Claude for architecture analysis
claude "Analyze planetary physics calculations"

# Use process-compose for parallel tasks
process-compose up dev-server &
```

### YOLO Mode Invocation
```bash
cline "implement feature" --yolo
cline "fix bug" --oneshot
```
