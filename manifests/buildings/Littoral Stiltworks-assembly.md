Littoral Stiltworks — Raised Drying Rack on Posts

Purpose
- Salt- and sun-drying of fish, seaweed, shellfish meats, herbs, and hides in a littoral (tidal) zone with high airflow and minimal moisture exposure.
- Elevation and exclusion features protect goods from tidal flooding, spray, and predators (birds, rodents, crabs).

Site and Environmental Parameters
- Location: upper intertidal to supratidal fringe; firm sandy/gravelly substrate preferred. Provide riprap if loose sand.
- Design tide/wave: deck set above 100‑year still water level + wave run-up + spray allowance. Example: if Highest Astronomical Tide = +2.2 m, storm surge = +0.8 m, wave runup/splash = +0.5 m, set deck bottom ≥ +4.0 m.
- Wind: design for 45 m/s 3-sec gust (or local equivalent, Exposure D).
- Corrosion: salt spray environment; use 316 stainless steel for critical fasteners, marine-grade timbers, UV-stable polymers.

Functional Layout and Crafting Stations (plan described from shore to sea)
- Shore abutment and prep bay (2.4 m length x full width)
  - Intake bench: 1.8 m long food-prep grade with seawater pump, splash back, drain to under-deck splash pad.
  - Sort bins (wet/dry), scale/scrape grates, tool rack, brine salinity gauge.
  - Floor: gritted decking with removable catch grate.

- Central roofed drying bay (3.6 m x 12.0 m, between handrails)
  - Two continuous rack aisles (1.2 m each) flanking a 1.2 m service corridor.
  - Rack tiers:
    - Lower tier +2.2 m: heavier items (fish filets, hides).
    - Upper tier +3.0 m: delicate herbs/seaweed; warmer, drier air.
  - Hinged mesh doors every 3.6 m for loading; internal tray staging bench 0.9 m high.
  - Overhead pulley lines to hoist tray stacks to upper tier.

- Open-air wings (0.6 m each side)
  - Quick-dry rails for line-drying nets and kelp ribbons.
  - Removable wind baffles (reed screens) for gusty conditions.

- Preservation corner (leeward, near shore side, 2.4 m x 2.4 m)
  - Brining vats (food-grade barrels) in shaded nook with drip edge.
  - Herb/salt mixing counter; scale; storage for salt in sealed bins.
  - Cold-smoke option: sub-deck smoke box with flue riser to a perforated plenum beneath one rack column (used in wet weather). Fire kept on shore pad; smoke ducted via 150 mm pipe.

- Packaging and dry storage locker (windward mid-bay, 1.2 m x 2.4 m)
  - Raised, gasketed locker with desiccant trays and rodent-proof vents.

- Net-mending and repair post (seaward end)
  - 2.4 m clear working circle; cleats, line spools, mend bench.

Moisture and Spoilage Mitigation
- High, ventilated roof with continuous ridge vent; translucent panels drive stack effect.
- Rain eaves and drip lines outside rack footprint; no direct rain fall on product.
- Slatted trays and 8 mm deck gaps for throughflow; no water pooling.
- Optional solar-assist: black-painted underside baffles create gentle updraft through racks; add 12 V marine fans (IP67) if needed.
- Hygrometers at three heights; flags indicate when RH > 75% so trays shift to smoke assist.

Predator Access Control
- Pile predator skirts: smooth FRP/copper bands deter climbing crabs/rodents.
- Rack enclosure mesh: 25 mm SS mesh blocks birds; 6 mm lower apron blocks rodents.
- Entry vestibules with spring return doors; footbath pan to discourage pests.
- Overhead offset perches 10 m away as decoy roosts lure birds off racks.
- Waste chute to tidal carrion ring beneath seaward end, timed to ebb tides to distract scavengers away from deck.

Evolutionary Triggers and Responsive Features
- Tidal flooding
  - Deck elevation set above design tide; racks additionally on lift rails with 0.5 t winch to raise trays +0.8 m when extreme events forecast.
  - Hinged gangway rises with tide; shear keys on pile caps resist float impact.
  - Float-sentinel: vertical float rod at seaward pile triggers bell and red flag when water reaches preset, cueing lift sequence.

- Spoilage from moisture
  - RH sensors and color flags; switch to cold-smoke plenum or solar-assist fans when RH > 75% for 2 hours.
  - Tray material choices (HDPE mesh) reduce moisture retention; staged spacing increases airflow.

- Predator access
  - Auto-drop bird net curtains weighted with shell bags deploy via counterweights at dusk or when motion chimes trigger repeatedly.
  - Rodent/rat guards at gangway; door sweeps close automatically.

Upgrade Pathways
- Height upgrade: add post extensions and second beam layer to raise racks by +0.6 to +1.2 m; extend winch line; add additional X-bracing.
- Capacity upgrade: add a fourth rack bay (extend deck to 16.8 m), duplicate pile bay; modular beam splices with fishplates.
- Climate upgrade: add full solar tunnel dryer module (polycarbonate sidewalls with adjustable louvers) over one rack aisle for all-weather drying.
- Energy upgrade: 200 W PV panel powering IP67 axial fans, RH/temp logging, red/amber warning beacons.
- Predator upgrade: electrified perimeter wire (low-voltage pulse) on handrail top; IR motion strobes on seaward edge.
- Corrosion upgrade: swap galvanized secondary hardware to 316 SS; add sacrificial zincs to SS frames near tidal splash zone.
- Storm upgrade: removable roof panels with quick-release; increase roof hold-down count; install storm shutters on gables.

Integration with Creature Behaviors (gameplay)
- Birds (gulls, terns): Provide decoy perch poles downwind with occasional scrap release to shift foraging behavior; net curtains drop at high activity times (dawn/dusk). Visual scare lines (taut monofilament) over rack ridge disrupt landing.
- Crabs and raccoons: Smooth predator skirts and mineral oil wipe discourage climbing; waste chute delivers scraps to ebb-tide zone away from piles to create alternative feeding corridor; crab pots positioned 10 m away draw scavengers off structure.
- Beneficial insects (drying efficiency): Install reed screens to host predatory insects that reduce blowfly larvae near prep area; smoke assist deters flies on humid days.
- Friendly symbionts: Encourage small fish schools under deck with shade to consume falling bits, reducing odor cues to predators.

Construction Sequence
1) Survey tides, soils (hand auger to 4 m), set datum and pile grid (2.4 m spacing).
2) Install riprap apron and geotextile at seaward bays (if needed).
3) Drive timber/FRP piles to refusal or design depth; cut tops to elevation; epoxy-seal cuts.
4) Fit caps/beams; install X-bracing and tension rods; torque-check M20 bolts; apply dielectric paste to mixed-metal points.
5) Install joists with hurricane ties; deck boards with 8 mm spacers; anti-slip grit zones.
6) Erect roof frames, purlins, polycarbonate; seal laps with UV silicone; ridge vent with bug mesh.
7) Build rack frames, runners, removable trays; fit lift rails and winch blocks.
8) Install mesh enclosures, bird nets, gangway, rails; fit predator skirts.
9) Fit stations: intake bench, rinse trough, brine vats, smoke plenum and flue, storage locker.
10) Commission float-sentinel, RH sensors, fans; test lift and storm-release procedures.

Operation and Maintenance
- Daily: hose deck at ebb tide; inspect mesh doors; rotate trays top/bottom to equalize drying.
- Weekly: rinse and fresh-water wash hardware; check winch cables and knots; oil predator skirts.
- Seasonal: tighten bolts; replace UV-exposed lines; inspect piles for borer or abrasion; replenish desiccants; swap bird net if UV-damaged.

Performance Targets
- Target drying airflow: 0.5–1.5 m/s across trays under typical sea breeze.
- Drying time (fish fillets 10–15 mm): 10–24 hours at RH < 65%, 20–48 hours with solar-assist fans at RH 65–80%.
- Predation loss rate: < 1% by mass per season with mesh and net curtains active.

Texture Mapping Notes
- Use WoodPlanks026 for deck albedo/normal; mix with WoodWorn008 in AO to achieve salt-weathering.
