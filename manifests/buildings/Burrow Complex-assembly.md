Burrow Complex — Single-Entrance Soil Fortress

Overview and scale
- Purpose: A single-navigable-entrance, multi-chamber earthen complex optimized for high surface predation risk, extreme temperatures, and long-term storage.
- Target occupant scale: Mid-sized burrower (baseline shoulder width S = 0.45 m; body length L = 0.9 m). All dimensions parametric to S.
- Traversable cross-section: Elliptical tunnels sized at 1.1S high x 1.3S wide (baseline: 0.50 m H x 0.58 m W). Chambers scale with S as noted.
- Cover depth: 1.2–1.5 m soil cover over main hall for thermal stability; 2.2–2.8 m depth for cool vault.
- Single-entrance rule: Only one traversable entrance. Auxiliary air shafts are ≤50 mm diameter with baffles; no secondary egress.

Site selection and orientation
- Slope: Place entrance on a 5–12% downslope shoulder, not in a swale. Orient entrance away from prevailing storm winds and direct summer sun (typically NE in mid-latitude northern hemisphere).
- Soil: Dense loam with 15–30% clay, 20–40% sand, 30–50% silt; UCS after compaction 150–300 kPa. Avoid collapsible loess; if sandier soil, increase wattle density and liner thickness.
- Water table: ≥1.0 m below cool vault floor. Add sump if seasonal rise expected.

Plan and dimensions (baseline S = 0.45 m; scale proportionally)
1) Entrance porch
- 0.60 m W x 0.45 m H mouth, recessed 0.6 m into a compacted berm (berm top width 1.0 m, height 0.5 m).
- Threshold stone ring (0.2 m thick) resists erosion and clawing.

2) S-curved approach tunnel
- Length 2.5 m, minimum 10° upward slope (0.44 m rise), then 5° down to vestibule; two 45° plan bends to break line of sight and wind.
- Cross-section: 0.50 m H x 0.58 m W (elliptical).

3) Plug pocket and choke
- Plug pocket at 0.8 m in: 0.55 m dia x 0.35 m deep recess holds a rammed-earth plug with fiber pull; choke width narrows to 0.40 m at a 0.4 m-long throat.

4) Guard alcove
- Side pocket 1.0 m from entrance: 0.90 m L x 0.70 m W x 0.50 m H with periscope slit (a 30 mm sound tube with reed baffle) toward entrance.

5) Vestibule
- 1.2 m L x 0.8 m W. Junction to main spine; coat with clay slip for dust control.

6) Main spine tunnel
- 3.0 m L gently descending to 1.5 m below grade, 0.50 m H x 0.62 m W; wattle-and-daub liner at crown.

7) Chambers off the spine (clockwise from entry):
- A. Workshop bay 1 (Soil/Daub): 0.9 m L x 0.7 m W x 0.55 m H alcove with mixing trough.
- B. Nursery/Nest: 1.6 m dia domed chamber, floor 1.7 m below grade; insulated ledge (0.15 m high) around perimeter.
- C. Dry store + smoker: 1.6 m L x 1.0 m W x 0.8 m H; upper shelves and baffled micro-vent to surface.
- D. Workshop bay 2 (Fiber/Resin): 1.0 m L x 0.8 m W x 0.6 m H with warm shelf (above flue).
- E. Latrine pit: 0.6 m dia x 0.5 m deep with insect gate and 30 mm vent to surface.
- F. Sump and drain node: 0.5 m dia x 0.5 m deep at lowest point, with gravel column.

8) Cool vault (deep node)
- Drop shaft 1.0 m L beyond main spine end, 20° down to 2.4 m depth.
- Vault 1.4 m dia, 0.9 m H; 0.2 m-thick clay liner; sealed amphorae storage ring.

Structural assembly
- Tunnel geometry: Elliptical crown radius = 0.35 m, invert radius = 0.30 m (baseline). Arch thickness (compacted daub liner) 0.06–0.10 m on crown where span >0.55 m.
- Liner system: Wattle-and-daub at crown and sidewalls where soil is weak; stone revetment at entrance and choke.
- Wattle grid: Twigs 8–12 mm diameter in a 120 x 120 mm lattice, tied with plant fiber; embedded 20–30 mm into daub.
- Daub mix (by volume): 1 clay-rich soil : 1 sharp sand : 0.25 chopped fiber (grass/roots). Moisture 8–12%. Ram to refusal.
- Expansion joints: Every 1.2 m, a 10 mm fiber-filled slip joint to handle seasonal movement.
- Roof cover: Minimum 1.2 m above main hall crown to damp temperature; 1.8 m over dry store to mitigate diurnal swings.

Drainage and waterproofing
- Entrance drip lip and stone threshold to shed inflow.
- Spine tunnel inverted camber to direct water to sump.
- Sump: Gravel column (20–40 mm) to dry well; charcoal layer above gravel for odor control.
- Clay slip waterproofing (2–3 mm) on chamber domes; beeswax-resin wash in dry store shelves.
- French drain under porch: 1.5 m long, 0.2 m dia filled with gravel.

Ventilation and thermal systems
- Air path: Single entrance provides intake. Buoyancy-driven exhaust via baffled micro-vents:
  - Dry store vent: 35–45 mm dia, 1.6 m rise, reed check-baffle prohibits entry.
  - Kiln/smoke flue: 40–50 mm dia, with side-draft cavity; surface cap camouflaged as a small mound with gravel mesh (aperture <20 mm).
  - Latrine vent: 25–30 mm dia with insect mesh and odor charcoal pit.
- Flow regulation: Adjustable reed plugs at each vent; smoke path is switchable to isolate nursery.
- Thermal mass: 1.2–1.5 m overburden stabilizes to mean annual soil temperature. Cool vault at 2.4 m depth maintains 6–10 C cooler than surface peaks (site dependent).
- Climate battery: In T3 upgrade, add a 2.0 m L side cavity filled with gravel for heat exchange of incoming air.

Anti-predation features
- Single, narrow choke with stone-clad sides, sized to S of occupant; predators with larger shoulder width cannot pass.
- Plug pocket: Quick-set rammed-earth plug seats into throat with wedge geometry.
- S-bends to block fast rush and line-of-sight attacks.
- Guard alcove with vibration lines: 2–3 taut fibers stretched to threshold stone; vibration telegraphs approach.
- Decoy scent pocket near porch (non-traversable 0.25 m dead-end) to distract scent-guided predators.
- Ceiling “sacrificial arch” over first 0.6 m of tunnel with weaker daub layer to collapse if breach; easy to rebuild.

Interior layout with functional “crafting” stations
- Soil/Daub station (Workshop bay 1)
  - Trough: 0.6 x 0.4 x 0.2 m with drip feed from water pot.
  - Output: structural daub, plug maintenance blocks, sealants.
- Fiber/Resin bay (Workshop bay 2)
  - Warm shelf above flue (35–45 C): resin curing, wax blending.
  - Peg board (root pegs) for drying cords, nets, basketry.
- Smoking niche (Dry store chamber)
  - Side-draft hearth pocket (0.25 m dia x 0.25 m deep) feeding baffled flue.
  - Ceiling hooks for racks; condensate gutter clay-lined.
- Fermentation pit (Cool vault or adjacent)
  - Clay amphorae embedded 1/3 height in floor; temperatures stable for long ferments.
- Knapping/Tool nook (Vestibule wall recess)
  - Stone anvil inset; bone/stone shard alcove; avoid in nursery for safety.
- Grooming sand bath (Opposite guard alcove)
  - 0.5 m dia, 0.1 m deep pan with dry sand/ash mix to control parasites.

Structural specifications and performance
- Allowable spans: Unlined soil tunnels ≤0.45 m span in dense loam. Lined spans up to 0.65 m with 60–100 mm daub arch and wattle grid.
- Safety factor: ≥2.0 against short-term collapse; increase liner thickness by 15% in wet seasons or sandier soils.
- Slope stability: Entrance berm face at 45° with light vegetation (root mat) or fascines.
- Freeze-thaw: Where frost depth >0.6 m, add 10 mm fiber expansion layer under porch and increase crown liner to 100–120 mm in first 1.5 m of tunnel.

Long-term storage systems
- Dry store (high, ventilated)
  - Conditions: 20–30% RH below ambient via warm flue and desiccant bowls (baked clay granules, salt).
  - Shelves: 0.15 m wide rung shelves at 0.25 m spacing; resin-sealed.
  - Capacity: ~0.08 m3 (baseline) of dried goods.
- Cool vault (deep, sealed)
  - Conditions: Low, stable temperature with minimal air exchange. Amphorae with wax-clay stoppers.
  - Floor: Slight dish to collect condensate to a drip cup.
  - Capacity: ~0.12 m3 sealed storage.
- Smoke preservation
  - Low, continuous airflow; flue baffle length ≥1.2 m to encourage soot deposition on walls, not goods.

Upgrade pathways by evolutionary triggers
Tier 0 (initial dig)
- Simple S-bend, nursery pocket, shallow sump, leaf nest. Materials: soil, leaves, basic wattle.

Tier 1 — predation_surface_high
- Add stone threshold ring and choke revetment.
- Install plug pocket and rammed-earth plug.
- Guard alcove with vibration lines.
- Decoy scent pocket near porch.
- Resource: small stones, extra fiber. Time: 1–2 cycles.

Tier 2 — temperature_extremes
- Increase cover depth to 1.2–1.5 m over main hall.
- Add clay daub liner to spine and nursery; clay slip on domes.
- Add dry store micro-vent with reed check valve.
- Resource: clay, sand, reed. Time: 2–3 cycles.

Tier 3 — long_term_storage

- Climate battery gravel cavity off spine; reed-plug valves for airflow tuning.
- Secondary buffered vestibule curtain (hanging root mat) to block drafts.
- Resource: gravel, extra wattle, fiber. Time: 2 cycles.

Integration with creature behaviors
- Sentinel behavior: Guard alcove provides acoustic line to entrance; scent post on porch stone directs territorial marking away from main airflow.
- Plug training: Occupants practice plug placement/removal from pocket; plug handle braided fiber sized to paw/grip anatomy.
- Thermoregulation: Seasonal nest rotation between nursery (warmer) and cool vault step ledge (cooler rest in heat waves).
- Cache/hide: Amphorae and shelf bins match bite-sized or paw-sized stashes; scent-diffusion clay lids reduce pilfering by surface predators.
- Grooming: Sand bath placed in airflow path to carry dander to sump, reducing scent plume.
- Waste separation: Latrine and insect gate encourage dung beetles/springtails; separate vent stops odor intrusion.

Construction phases and resource tally (baseline)
- Earth moved: ~4.5–6.0 m3 total (soil density ~1.6 t/m3).
- Wattle: 40–60 m of twigs 8–12 mm diameter.
- Clay daub: 0.25–0.35 m3 wet volume.
- Stone: 0.15–0.25 m3 for threshold, choke, and small revetments.
- Gravel: 0.10–0.20 m3 for sump and climate battery.
- Fiber: 60–90 m of plant fiber cord; 3–5 m2 of root/grass mats.
- Resin/wax: 1–2 kg for sealing shelves and amphorae stoppers.
- Build time: Staged across 6–12 in-game days depending on labor units and soil hardness.

Assembly notes
- Keep micro-vents ≤50 mm diameter and baffle them to preserve single-entrance traversal rule.
- Elliptical crowns outperform flat roofs in soft soils; maintain continuous curve with a simple bending jig for wattle ribs.
- Reapply clay slip in high-touch areas seasonally; renew leaves in nest and desiccants in dry store every storage cycle.
- Monitor for condensation in cool vault; add charcoal packet to absorb odor and balance humidity.

This assembly delivers a realistic, purpose-built, single-entrance burrow that lets players evolve defenses against predators, buffer temperature extremes via thermal mass and controlled ventilation, and maintain robust long-term storage through paired dry and cool systems, while providing meaningful interior “crafting” stations that feed back into structural upgrades.
