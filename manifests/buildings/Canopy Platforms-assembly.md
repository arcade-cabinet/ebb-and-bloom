Canopy Platforms: Single-Tree Lashed Platform

Purpose and triggers
- Purpose: Elevated, minimal-impact platform lashed to living branches for safe observation, light crafting, and overhead storage.
- Evolutionary triggers addressed:
  - fall_risk: full-perimeter guard, fall-arrest anchor points, under-deck safety net.
  - storm_damage: flexible, non-penetrating connections that accommodate sway; storm-lashing kit and guying strategy; slatted, low-sail deck; sacrificial components.
  - need_for_overhead_storage: block-and-tackle hoist, suspended racks under and above deck, pest/raider deterrence.

Site selection and tree criteria
- Tree type: mature broadleaf or conifer with 3+ primary limbs in one plane around the trunk.
- Limb diameter: minimum 250 mm at the platform level for primary supports; secondary limbs ≥150 mm for guy lines/overhead hoist.
- Limb spacing: 90–140 degrees between primary supports (3-branch configuration ideal).
- Health: no rot, fungal conks, fresh cracks, or heavy deadwood above. Bark intact, good leafing.
- Height: 8–15 m above ground for safety and reduced trunk sway; avoid crown apex.
- Sway clearance: minimum 1.5 m to adjacent trees/structures.

Overall geometry and dimensions (baseline “Mk I – Tri-Radial”)
- Planform: circular deck supported by three radial carrier beams to three branches.
- Deck diameter: 3.0 m (usable area ≈ 7.1 m²).
- Deck elevation: variable; top of deck sits 200–300 mm above top of carrier beams.
- Guardrail height: 1.1 m above deck; toe-kick 75 mm.
- Under-deck safety net: spans full deck, 1.2 m below deck underside.
- Access: rope ladder + belay line on the downwind/leeward side; hatch 700 x 700 mm.

Structural system
1) Primary support (radial carriers to branches)
- Carrier beams: 3 pcs, 90 x 140 mm (nominal) laminated timber, length 2.0 m from deck center to branch cradles. Wood grade: structural softwood GL24h or hardwood equivalent.
- Branch cradles: laminated cradle blocks contoured to branch radius; minimum bearing area per cradle: 400 cm² to limit bark/cambium pressure <0.2 MPa.
- Cambium protection: 8–10 mm thick rubber or felt pads between cradle and bark, plus wide sling/cambium savers (60–80 mm webbing).
- Lashings at each cradle:
  - Pattern: square lashing with 2 frapping turns; two independent redundant lashings per cradle.
  - Rope: Option A (natural): 16 mm hemp/manila, MBS ≥ 40 kN; Option B (synthetic, low-creep HMPE/Dyneema): 10–12 mm, MBS ≥ 70 kN with abrasion sleeves over bark.
  - Pre-tension: 3–5 kN per lashing (use progress-capture pulley or Spanish windlass; verify with inline load cell if available).
  - Factor of safety (connection): ≥ 4 on worst-case branch load.

2) Ring and joists
- Inner compression ring: hexagon of 6 pcs 45 x 90 mm members bolted into a near-circle (internal flat-to-flat ≈ 1.2 m). Serves as joist hub and distributes load.
- Rim beam: circular rim made from 8 segments, 45 x 120 mm scarf-joined with stainless straps; OD 3.0 m.
- Joists: 12 pcs, 45 x 90 mm radiating from inner ring to rim at 15° spacing; hung with rope sockets at inner ring to allow micro-movements.
- Lateral bracing: 6 mm stainless wire or 10 mm rope X-braces under joists tying opposing sectors.

3) Decking and rails
- Decking: 38 x 90 mm slats, gapped 8–10 mm for drainage; radial alignment. Anti-slip finish.
- Guardrail posts: 60 mm roundwood stanchions lashed to rim at 500 mm spacing. Top rail 45 x 70 mm, mid-rail 600 mm above deck. Rail infill: netting (100 mm mesh) tensioned to posts.
- Toe-kick: 25 x 100 mm band on rim interior.

4) Dynamic accommodation and storm features
- Sway allowances: slotted rope sockets at inner ring; lashings not hard-fixed to allow micro-slip; never rigidly bolt to living wood.
- Guy lines: 3–6 auxiliary guy lines (8–10 mm rope) from rim to secondary branches at 15–25° down angle; quick-release storm cleats allow tightening before storms.
- Storm kit: additional storm lashings stored on board to double up over primaries; removable storm tarpaulin reefs to minimize sail area; stow all hanging items.
- Lightning: avoid tall metallic masts; if any metal hardware is used, keep bonded together and away from touch points during storms; evacuate during severe lightning.

Loads and capacity (Mk I)
- Design live load: 3.0 kN/m² (outdoor assembly), deck area 7.1 m² → 21.3 kN live load.
- Dead load (structure + gear): ≈ 3.5 kN.
- Total design load: ≈ 24.8 kN. With three primaries, tributary ≈ 8.3 kN per branch; lashings sized with FoS ≥ 4.
- Occupancy: up to 6 persons standing or 3 persons with gear for crafting/rest.

Interior layout and functional areas
- Plan zoning (clock face):
  - 12–2 o’clock: Access hatch (700 x 700 mm), belay plate with two rated anchors (≥ 12 kN).
  - 2–5 o’clock: Crafting bay (cold-work only):
    - Clamp-on vise block on rim.
    - Cordage station pegboard.
    - Small hand-tool rack and drop-prevention lanyards.
    - Fold-down work surface 800 x 400 mm.
  - 5–8 o’clock: Storage and hoist zone:
    - Overhead block-and-tackle hoist (3:1) off a sound overhead branch, WLL 150 kg; rat guard cone above hook.
    - Suspended storage baskets under deck (bear/raider resistant lids).
    - Weather-tight cache box lashed to rim (not on deck surface).
  - 8–10 o’clock: Rest/sentinel:
    - Hammock anchor rings, diagonal span 2.7–3.0 m.
    - Seat slats and binocular perch.
  - 10–12 o’clock: Drying/curing:
    - Under-tarp drying lines, drip trays; removable shade cloth to control airflow.
- Fire policy: no open flame on deck. Heat-based crafting, if essential, is done on a remote ground pad. On-deck only spark-proof alcohol stove in extreme need, with fire blanket and water at hand, and only with storm tarp removed.

Creature behavior integration
- Deterrence of large climbers: smooth collar wraps on trunk below platform; angled standoff spikes under access only (non-lethal).
- Mutualism attractors: perch rods for insectivorous birds at 2–3 m from platform to reduce pest insects; resin catch for sap feeders located away from access to lure them off deck.
- Noise and scent: food stored in sealed suspended containers; scented deterrent sachets near hatch discourage scavengers.
- Nocturnal fliers/gliders: red low-intensity marker beads on guy lines; keep clear fly-through corridors between 3–9 o’clock.
- Cleanliness: shed crumbs and waste down a controlled chute away from trunk to avoid attracting burrowers to the trunk base.

Assembly sequence (rope-first, minimal tree impact)
1) Ground pre-fabrication: assemble inner ring, rim segments, and joists into three transportable sub-assemblies; pre-drill bolt holes; pre-cut decking slats; pre-rig lashings and pads onto cradle blocks.
2) Rigging: install throw lines to selected branches; haul up cambium savers and fixed slings; pre-place hoist anchor on overhead limb.
3) Cradle install: lift cradle blocks into position on each primary branch with pads; loosely secure with initial lashing wraps (no full tension).
4) Carrier placement: hoist each carrier beam into its cradle; add temporary safety tethers; align level with sight line and temporary rope jacks.
5) Hub and joists: hoist inner ring; pin carriers to ring via rope sockets; install radial joists; lightly tension lashings to seat all bearings.
6) Rim and bracing: install rim segments; add under-slung X-bracing; tighten lashings in a star pattern to 3–5 kN per lashing.
7) Decking and rails: lay slats from center outward; lash guard posts; install top/mid rails and net infill; fit toe-kick.
8) Safety net and access: rig under-deck net; install rope ladder and belay anchors; verify clear descent path.
9) Storage and stations: hang hoist; mount fold-down bench and tool lanyards; rig drying lines; stow storm kit.
10) Test and tune: proof-load incrementally to 1.5x expected live load while monitoring branch deflection and lashing seating; retension as needed.

Maintenance and tree health
- Weekly in first month, then monthly: inspect lashings for creep; retension 5–10%.
- Seasonal: shift cradle positions a few cm to avoid girdling; replace abrasion sleeves; check bark health; prune deadwood above.
- Post-storm: inspect guy lines, frapping turns, and joist bracing; replace any glazed rope segments.

Upgrade pathways
- Mk 0 (Scout Pad): 2.2 m deck, 2 carriers + trunk standoff, partial rail. For quick observation.
- Mk I (Baseline, above): 3.0 m deck, 3 carriers, full rail/netting, hoist and under-deck storage.
- Mk II (Reinforced): add a tensioned perimeter band (webbing or cable) around rim; increase guy lines to 6; add anti-oscillation damper (sand-filled bag under deck on short tether). Raise live load rating to 4.0 kN/m²; add rain tarp with reefing points.
- Mk III (Storm-Hardened): dual lashings per cradle with opposite lay; quick-stow rail curtains; detachable storm shrouds; lightning standoff rope (wet hemp dropline to ground away from trunk base during storms). Add secondary mini-platform for redundant refuge.
- Mk IV (Networked Canopy): connect to neighboring trees via 300–500 mm wide suspended footbridges; add zipline hub and cargo trolley; integrate modular pod (1.8 x 1.8 m) sleeping shelter on separate branch supports.
